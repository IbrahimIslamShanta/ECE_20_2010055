## 5. Discussion:

In this experiment, the focus was on creating well-structured documentation using Markdown language. The document demonstrated various Markdown features such as headers, emphasis, tables, images, links, and code blocks.

1. **Headers**: Different levels of headers were used, ranging from `Header 1` & `Header 6`, to organize the content in a hierarchical manner. This is important for readability and structuring documents logically.

2. **Emphasis**: Markdown offers multiple ways to emphasize text. Italics were applied using both underscores (`_`) and stars (`*`), while bold text was demonstrated using double underscores (`__`) and double stars (`**`). Additionally, bold and italic combinations were shown to highlight key points within the text.

3. **Strike-through**: The example also illustrated how to apply strike-through to text using `~~`. This can be helpful in situations where one wants to indicate outdated or irrelevant information without removing it.

4. **Links**: Links to external websites were embedded, showing how Markdown simplifies adding hyperlinks without complex HTML tags. This enhances navigation, making the document interactive and resourceful.

5. **Tables**: The inclusion of a table demonstrated how Markdown can organize data effectively in a tabular format. This is especially useful for presenting structured information like comparisons, datasets, or lists.

6. **Images**: Adding images within Markdown was shown by embedding a link to a remote image. This capability allows for visual content to be integrated seamlessly into documents, enriching the user experience.

Overall, this experiment demonstrated the versatility and simplicity of Markdown for creating professional and structured documents. It is particularly useful in environments like GitHub, technical blogs, or collaborative documentation, where quick formatting and readability are key. Markdown’s lightweight syntax allows for swift adoption while maintaining clarity across different types of content.

## 2. Experiment Name:  
Best Coding Practices

## 3. Objectives:  
- To apply best coding practices in Python programming.
- To write clean, efficient, and modular Python code.
- To ensure code readability and maintainability for collaborative work.

## 4. Source Code and Description:

### **Source Code** (Example in Python):
```python
def calculate_sum(a, b):
    return a + b

def display_result(sum_value):
    print(f"The sum is: {sum_value}")

def main():
    try:  
        num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
        num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
     
        sum_value = calculate_sum(num1, num2)
 
        display_result(sum_value)
    
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input! Please enter valid integers.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### **Description**:  
In this Python example, several best coding practices are followed:

1. **Modular Code**: The logic is divided into three functions: `calculate_sum`, `display_result`, and `main`. This makes the code more modular and easier to maintain.
2. **Descriptive Naming**: Function and variable names like `calculate_sum`, `display_result`, `num1`, `num2`, and `sum_value` clearly describe their purpose, improving code readability.
3. **Error Handling**: A `try-except` block is used to catch `ValueError` exceptions, ensuring the program handles invalid user input gracefully.
4. **Code Efficiency**: The program is efficient with clear separation of concerns — one function handles calculations, another handles display, and the main function manages input and program flow.
5. **Main Function Check**: The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block ensures that the `main()` function runs only when the script is executed directly, not when it is imported as a module in other programs.

## 5. Discussion:

In this experiment, we focused on implementing **best coding practices** in Python to enhance code quality. Here are the key elements:

1. **Modularity**: Breaking the program into smaller functions (for calculation, displaying output, and managing input) follows the **single responsibility principle**. Each function does one task, making the code easier to test, debug, and modify.

2. **Descriptive Names**: Choosing clear and descriptive function and variable names improves the readability of the code. Future developers (or your future self) will quickly understand the purpose of each function and variable.

3. **Error Handling**: The `try-except` block prevents the program from crashing when the user inputs something other than an integer. Handling exceptions is a crucial practice in robust software development.

4. **Main Function**: The use of `if __name__ == "__main__":` follows Python's convention for structuring programs. It ensures that the code behaves correctly whether it's run directly or imported into another module.

5. **Maintainability**: The program is structured in a way that makes it easy to maintain and extend. For example, adding new features (like multiplying numbers) would involve adding another function without affecting the rest of the code.

By following these best practices, the Python code becomes cleaner, more organized, and easier to understand and maintain, which is especially valuable in collaborative projects and when working on larger codebases.


## 1. Experiment No:
**3**

## 2. Experiment Name:
Study of Key Git Commands

## 3. Objectives:
- To explore and understand essential Git commands.
- To learn how to use Git for effective version control and team collaboration.
- To practice using Git commands to manage repositories and code changes.

## 4. Theory:
Git is a powerful, distributed version control system used to track changes in a project's source code. It allows multiple developers to collaborate without overwriting each other's work. Git stores code in repositories, with each set of changes saved as a "commit." Developers can work on different branches and later merge their work together. This experiment focuses on exploring fundamental Git commands and understanding their roles in managing repositories and projects efficiently.

### Common Git Commands:
1. `git init`: Sets up a new Git repository.
2. `git clone`: Creates a copy of an existing repository.
3. `git status`: Displays the current state of the repository.
4. `git add`: Moves changes to the staging area for committing.
5. `git commit`: Saves the staged changes to the repository.
6. `git log`: Shows the commit history.
7. `git push`: Uploads changes to a remote repository.
8. `git pull`: Downloads and merges updates from a remote repository.
9. `git branch`: Creates, lists, or deletes branches.
10. `git merge`: Combines changes from different branches.

## 5. Procedure:

1. **Initialize a Git repository**:
   - Run `git init` to set up a new repository.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git init
     ```

2. **Clone a remote repository**:
   - Use `git clone` to copy an existing repository from a remote server.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
     ```

3. **Check repository status**:
   - Run `git status` to check the current state of the repository.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git status
     ```

4. **Stage changes**:
   - Use `git add` to move changes into the staging area.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git add filename.txt
     git add .
     ```

5. **Commit changes**:
   - Run `git commit` to save the staged changes with a descriptive message.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Initial commit"
     ```

6. **View the commit history**:
   - Use `git log` to display the repository’s commit history.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git log
     ```

7. **Push changes to a remote repository**:
   - Use `git push` to send your commits to a remote repository (like GitHub).
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git push origin main
     ```

8. **Pull updates from a remote repository**:
   - Use `git pull` to fetch and integrate changes from a remote repository.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git pull origin main
     ```

9. **Create and switch branches**:
   - Use `git branch` to create and switch to a new branch.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git branch feature-branch
     git checkout feature-branch
     ```

10. **Merge branches**:
    - Use `git merge` to combine changes from one branch into another.
    - Example:
      ```bash
      git checkout main
      git merge feature-branch
      ```

## 6. Source Code and Output:

### Commands:
```bash
# Initialize a new repository
git init

# Clone a repository
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git

# Check the repository's status
git status

# Stage changes for commit
git add .

# Commit staged changes
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Push changes to a remote repository
git push origin main

# Pull updates from a remote repository
git pull origin main

# Create a new branch
git branch feature-branch

# Merge a branch into the main branch
git merge feature-branch
```

### Output:
These commands allow you to set up and manage a Git repository, track changes, collaborate with other developers, and merge changes efficiently.

## 7. Discussion:
This experiment provided a hands-on understanding of the basic Git commands used in version control systems. 

1. **Repository Setup**: We used `git init` to create a new repository from scratch and `git clone` to copy an existing one, enabling the management of projects and contributing to remote repositories.

2. **Tracking Changes**: `git status` helps developers see which files have changed and whether they’ve been staged for commit. `git add` stages the changes, preparing them to be committed to the repository.

3. **Committing and Pushing**: By using `git commit`, we save changes locally with a detailed message. Later, `git push` allows us to share these commits with collaborators on a remote repository.

4. **Branching and Merging**: With `git branch`, we manage different features or bug fixes in isolation, and `git merge` lets us combine changes into the main branch once they are complete.
